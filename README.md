2. Listening for Commands
The assistant continuously listens for your voice commands using the speech_recognition library. It uses the microphone to capture audio input.

3. Processing Commands
Once a command is recognized, the assistant processes it to determine the appropriate action. The recognized command is converted to lowercase to ensure consistency in processing.

5. Continuous Interaction
The assistant continuously listens for new commands and performs the corresponding actions. It provides voice feedback for each action, making the interaction more engaging and user-friendly.

6. Stopping the Assistant
If you say "stop", "quit", "bye", or "exit", the assistant will stop listening and terminate the program.

Performance and User Experience
